In the main.py file, I have loaded each and every one of the files included in this project, and given them names corresponding to what they represent.
If you were to run the file, it would generate all of the results and screenshots that are shown on the report.
It would also generate a  predictions.csv file that is specifically for the Kaggle competition.

The implementation for the code is fairly self-explanatory, I first load all of the different npy and csv files, I then loop through all the
different models and train each of them to compare their prediction results. After that, I perform cross-validation to find the best fold for predicting
salary_bin, the best fold is then used to also predict the valid.csv set. Finally, I ran a loop that implements self-training by adding the highest
confidence predictions from the unlabeled data set to the labeled data set, then export the new training set as a csv file to predict the test.csv set for the
Kaggle competition.

Note that the code may be slightly hard to read as I am aware that the code will not be assessed and only the results will be used for my research,
therefore I invested more time in writing the report rather than making the code look nice.
